## Notes

Since opt folder is too heavy to include in source control it is being ignored and must be mannualy copied to the host system and then it has to be mapped to the virtual directory inside the docker container.

## Persiste directory

/opt/www626:/opt/www626

## App port

Set app port to '''8080'''

## MySQL database

See values from '''opt/www626/liferay-portal-6.2-ce-ga6/portal-setup-wizard.properties'''
